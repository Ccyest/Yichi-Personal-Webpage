      <description>Introduction In the realm of distributed systems, achieving consensus among nodes is a fundamental challenge. The Raft consensus algorithm, developed by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout, has emerged as a popular choice for its simplicity, understandability, and strong consistency guarantees. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a deep dive into the Raft algorithm, exploring its key components, working principles, and practical applications.&#xA;Advantages of Raft Raft offers several advantages over other consensus algorithms:</description>
